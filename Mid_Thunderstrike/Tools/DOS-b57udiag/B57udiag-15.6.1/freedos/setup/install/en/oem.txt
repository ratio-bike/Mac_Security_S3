
    Ready to install the FreeDOS software?  You should have already
    created your install floppies, or dumped all the install files
    into a single directory on your hard disk.
    
    Floppy access is still a little slow.  If you are installing this
    from a boot floppy using FreeDOS, then you will find that the
    install process is a little longer than you expect.  FreeDOS works
    fine once you boot from the hard disk, though.
